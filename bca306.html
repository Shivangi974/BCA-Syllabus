      consumption of energy: FOR the first 100 units - 50P per unit, For next 200 units - 80P per unit
      Beyond 300 units - 90P per unit. All users are charged a minimum of Rs.50.00. if the total amount is more than
      Rs.300.00 then an additional surcharge of 15% is added.Write a C++
      program to read the names of users and number of units consumed and print out the charges
      with names. <br> <b>Ex 1B:</b> switch.. case statements and do .. while loop <br>
      An election is contested by five candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5 and a voting
      is done by marking the candidate number in a ballot paper. Write a C++ program to read the
      ballot and count the votes cast for each candidate using an array variable count. In case, a
      number read is outside the range 1 to 5 the ballot should be considered as a ‘spoilt ballot’,
      and the program should also count the number of spoilt ballots <br> <b>Ex 1C:</b> for loop - <br> Write a C++
      program to print the different Pyramid structures
      <br> <b>Ex 1D: </b> while loop Write a C++ program to print the Fibonacci series 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 …. By
      getting number of number to be displayed is given as input Eg. 5 is input value means it should
